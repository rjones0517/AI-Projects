# AI-Projects
**Description** This repository contains the project personal reports of projects completed in my Artificail Intelligence course at Texas State. It includes an intelligent system that uses backward-chaining to diganose a type of cancer, and then uses forward-chaining to give a treatment. It also contains two cpu based game reports. One uses the MIN-MAX algorithm with different evaluation functions to play connect 4 against eachother. The other uses the A* Search and different heuristic functions to solve a 9 square puzzle eachother. Along with the report of how each program functioned.
