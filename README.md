# AI-Projects
**Description** This repository holds the folders containing the source code and materials to the gorup projects completed in my Artificail Intelligence course at Texas State. It includes an intelligent system that uses backward-chaining to diganose a type of cancer, and then uses forward-chaining to give a treatment. It also contains two cpu based games. One uses the MIN-MAX algorithm with different evaluation functions to play connect 4 against eachother. The other uses the A* Search and different heuristic functions to play TikTacToe agaisnt eachother. Along with the report of how each program functioned.
